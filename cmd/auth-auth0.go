The Auth0 application is defined in the node's configuration. Users must be part of the Auth0 directory and have permissions to use the app.

Once you have authenticated with Auth0, the client obtains an OAuth token which it uses to authorize API calls with the node. Tokens have a limited lifespan, which is configurable by the admin (stkcli supports automatically refreshing tokens when possible).
