name: stkcli site add
synopsis: Add a new site
description: |
  Configures a new site in the node.

  Each site is identified by a primary domain, and it can have multiple aliases (domain names that are redirected to the primary one).

  When creating a site, you must specify the name of a TLS certificate stored on the associated Azure Key Vault instance. You can also specify `selfsigned` as a value for the TLS certificate to have the node automatically generate a self-signed certificate for your site. If you omit the `--certificate` option, it will default to a self-signed certificate.
