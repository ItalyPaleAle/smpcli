name: stkcli site add
synopsis: Add a new site
description: |
  Configures a new site in the node.

  Each site is identified by a primary domain, and it can have multiple aliases (domain names that are redirected to the primary one).

  Alternatively, you can specify the `--temporary` option to create a temporary site, for example for testing an application. When creating temporary sites, a domain name will be generated for you, and you should not provide domain names or aliases.

  When creating a site, you must specify the name of a TLS certificate stored in the node or cluster. Alternatively, you can pass one of the following values:

    - `selfsigned` for generating a self-signed certificate for your site
    - `acme` for requesting a certificate from an ACME provider, such as Let's Encrypt (not available for temporary sites)
    - `akv:[name]:[version]` for requesting a certificate stored in the Azure Key Vault instance associated with the cluster; the version is optional.

  If you omit the `--certificate` option, it will default to a self-signed certificate.
