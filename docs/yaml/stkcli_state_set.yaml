name: stkcli state set
synopsis: Restores the state of a node
description: |
  Replaces the state of the node with the one read from file (or stdin if the '--file' parameter is not set).

  The state is a JSON document containing the list of sites and apps to be configured in the web server, and it's normally exported from another node (useful for backups or migrations).

  This command completely replaces the state of the node with the one you're passing to the command, discarding any site or app currently configured in the node.
options:
- name: file
  shorthand: f
  usage: |
    file containing the desired state; if not set, read from stdin
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for set
- name: http
  shorthand: S
  default_value: "false"
  usage: use HTTP protocol, without TLS
- name: insecure
  shorthand: k
  default_value: "true"
  usage: disable TLS certificate validation
- name: node
  shorthand: "n"
  default_value: localhost
  usage: node address or IP
- name: port
  shorthand: P
  default_value: "2265"
  usage: port the node listens on
