name: stkcli app upload
synopsis: Upload an app or bundle
description: |
  Uploads an app or app bundle to the node, to be stored in the node's app repository.

  This command accepts four parameters:

  - `--path` is the path to a file or folder to upload
  - `--app` is the name of the name of the bundle, which can be used to identify the app when you want to deploy it in a node (do not include an extension)
  - `--signing-key` is the path to a private RSA key used for codesigning

  Paths can be folders containing your app's files; stkcli will automatically create a tar.bz2 archive for you. Alternatively, you can point the `--path` parameter to an existing archive (various formats are supported, including zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2, and more), and it will uploaded as-is.

  App names must be unique. You cannot re-upload an app using the same file name.
