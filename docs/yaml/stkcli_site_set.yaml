name: stkcli site set
synopsis: Updates the configuration for a site
description: |
  Updates a site configured in the node.

  When creating a site, you must specify the name of a TLS certificate stored in the node or cluster. Alternatively, you can pass one of the following values:

    - `selfsigned` for generating a self-signed certificate for your site
    - `acme` for requesting a certificate from an ACME provider, such as Let's Encrypt
    - `akv:[name]:[version]` for requesting a certificate stored in the Azure Key Vault instance associated with the cluster; the version is optional.

  If you omit the `--certificate` option, it will default to a self-signed certificate.

  The `--alias` parameter is used to replace the list of aliases configured for the domain. You can use this parameter multiple time to add more than one alias. Note that using the `--alias` flag will replace the entire list of aliases with the new one.
