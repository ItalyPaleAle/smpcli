name: stkcli upload certificate
synopsis: Upload a TLS certificate
description: |
  Adds a TLS certificate (public certificate and private key) to the Azure Key Vault instance connected to the node.

  IMPORTANT: In order to use this command, you must have the Azure CLI installed and you must be authenticated to the Azure subscription where the Key Vault resides (with `az login`). Additionally, your Azure account must have the following permissions in the Key Vault's data plane: keys (create, update, import, sign), certificate (create, update, import).

  This command accepts three parameters:

  - `--name` or `-c` is the name of the certificate, which you can use to reference it in sites' configuration. Per Azure, it can only contain uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and the dash symbol (-)
  - `--certificate` or `-f` is the file with the public part of the TLS certificate
  - `--certificate-key` or `-p` is the file with the private key of the certificate

  Note that only certificates with RSA keys are supported. Additionally, both the certificate and the key must be in PEM format.
